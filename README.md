# Feature-Enhancement-Attack
A white-box iterative adversarial attack against image classification

## Introduction
This repository contains the code for the real data experiments of Feature Enhancement Attack, based on the layer-wise relevance propagation.
- [On Pixel-Wise Explanations for Non-Linear Classifier Decisions by Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0130140)

## Method
The adversarial examples are generated by extracting the pixels that are most relevant for the prediction of the model via later-wise relevance propagation (LRP) and modifying them with different stategies.
